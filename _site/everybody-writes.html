    <p>One of my goals when starting this site was to knock out a blog post every week documenting my coding journey.
<!--more-->
This task seemed easy and achievable but after struggling through my first three posts I realized I didn’t really know how to write. A blog post every week became more of a chore and less of the free-flowing creative exercise I thought it would be.</p>

<p>I was constantly running into questions about punctuation, grammar, and the flow of blog posts. Familiar with the wireframing process for the layout of websites and apps, there was probably some process to organize the structure of my writing. I just needed to learn how.</p>

<p>To improve my writing for blogs specifically, I turned to Google and read Amazon reviews for recommended books. This led me to buy Everybody Writes by Ann Handley. Honestly, I struck gold. It included all the advice I was looking for and more I didn’t know I needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everybody Writes is designed to be your go-to guide for creating or publishing any kind of online content- whether you’re working for a big brand or a small business… or yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first, I was surprised by the size of the book. It holds like a novel and reads easily like a comedian’s memoir. Even though the content is very comprehensive, it is organized well and to the point.  I felt like I met a new friend that shared her juicy secrets of the online marketing world with me over pedicures and mimosas.</p>

<p>As I started reading this book I immediately identified as one of the many people she was writing for. Really understanding that everyone is a writer whether they think they are or not. She makes writing better seem possible and not some huge undertaking.</p>

<!-- It became clear to me that I no longer needed to write better blogs as much as I needed to become better in all my writing, including my social media platforms. My writing is my voice to the masses (or select few) and will help establish my online identity and personal brand. Chapter Voice and Tone brought that to light with really funny examples. -->

<blockquote>
  <p>“The truth is this: writing well is part habit, part knowledge of some fundamental rules, and part giving a damn.” Ann writes on the first page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely give a damn. I can learn the fundamental rules but writing as a habit… that will take the most work for me. To become a better writer, you must write. Something I try to keep in mind for coding as well. I should probably also add going to the gym as a habit-in-progress.</p>

<!-- *A note on sticky-notes*

With all my books I use as study material I sticky-note the hell out of them. I can easily go through the book from one point of relevance to another, thanks to me taking each page seriously and marking what is important information for me. Having fun color-coded notes allows a ton of information to be easily attainable whenever I need it.

Getting back to Everybody Writes, I mentioned earlier that this was filled with information I didn't know I needed.  I was concerned with grammar and spelling thinking that was what I should be concerned about. As Ann states in Part Two of her book: "Most people think that writing is grammar. But good writing is more about thinking, rewriting, and keeping your focus relentlessly on the reader." She has grammar and usage in part two of her book because she believes "in many ways grammar and usage are secondary". -->

<!-- Part One gave me a lot of tools for how to think about my writing. (Which I never gave much thought to until now). Some of the chapters that I am really going to begin incorporating in my writing include:

Follow a Writing GPS
Place The Most Important Words (and Ideas) at the Beginning of Each Sentence
Embrace The Ugly First Draft
There are six total parts to the just under 300-page book but I am not going to go in depth with them here. Other need to know subjects Ann fills you in on are: how to write ethically, writing for social media, and marketing content. She also gives an extensive list of tools for editing, writing, image sources and more. -->

<p>Everybody Writes is full of useful information. Every page included smart advice and entertaining examples. I got very lucky choosing this as my first how-to-write book and feel like any other one will now just be disappointing.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this book to everybody since, after all, everybody writes.</p>
